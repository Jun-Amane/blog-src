  <div class="prose prose-indigo max-w-none"><p>0x00: Abstract<br />
<br />
  Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t suit you, or maybe it does — that&rsquo;s up to you. The only thing I care about is that it suits me.<br /></p>
<p>0x01: Background<br />
<br />
  In June 2022, after the Summer NEMT ended, I bought a new phone — the 3rd generation iPhone SE — to prepare for my upcoming university life.<br />
  During high school, I had two phones for daily use. One was an iPhone 6s — which I assembled myself from second-hand parts, making it very affordable. It served as my primary device for five years, handling communication, gaming, and entertainment. The other was a Huawei Mate 8, codename NEXT, originally used by my father for work until he accidentally dropped it into water. Although we repaired the motherboard, it still had issues — such as losing power rapidly, sometimes draining over 10,000mAh just to charge. So that phone was mostly left at home for running &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; apps like WeChat and QQ.<br />
  It was time for an upgrade.<br />
  Personally, I prefer Apple products. Thanks to Mr. Jobs, Apple devices reflect a unique design philosophy that’s hard to replicate. I often grumble about iOS’s limitations, but when it comes to design, I have no complaints — perhaps that’s what they mean by “Only the paranoid survive.”<br /></p>
<p>0x02: Evaluation<br />
<br />
  I chose the red version — the other two options were “Midnight” and “Starlight.” After seeing them in person, I found that “Starlight” looked like a slightly yellowish white, while “Midnight” leaned more toward dark blue. Neither looked as vivid as the red, which felt more pure to me. Of course, the choice is yours. (PRODUCT)RED is labeled on the back — likely tied to charitable contributions.<br /></p>

<img src="SCR.JPG" alt="Screen"><br />
<br /></p>
<p>  The 3rd-gen iPhone SE inherits the design of its predecessor, with a 4.7-inch screen — the same size as the iPhone 6s. After five years of using the 6s, it feels naturally comfortable to use (lol).<br />
  A friend once teased me, “What era do you think this is?” regarding the 4.7-inch screen. I replied: “If you’re referring to the non-full-screen display, that’s my personal choice, lol. But if it’s about screen size — remember, with that so-called ‘small’ screen, I completed <em>Summer Pockets</em> (over 2 million words), defeated Herrscher 2, liberated the Reunion, and explored every corner of Teyvat.”<br />
  This iPhone SE is probably the only globally sold smartphone without a full-screen display — and that’s exactly one of the reasons I chose it. Let me explain.<br /></p>
<p>  The phones I’ve used before:<br />
    — Nokia N97 mini, 360x640 (Primary School, Grade 3–4)<br />
    — Samsung Galaxy S4, 1920x1080 (Grade 4–Junior High Grade 2)<br />
    — iPhone 6s, 1334x750 (Junior High Grade 2–present)<br />
    — Huawei Mate 8, 1920x1080 (Junior High Grade 2–present)<br /></p>
<p>  Despite their different resolutions, they all share one thing: the classic 16:9 aspect ratio. Over the years, I’ve developed a habit — modern phones with 2:1 displays always feel&hellip; weird in my hands.<br />
  I also prefer 16:9 for watching videos and viewing CGs in games. Most media is still produced in 16:9, and while it’s not a dealbreaker, there <em>is</em> a difference. Let me share a story.<br /></p>
<p>  Before the NEMT, I was playing the <em>Shiroha</em> route in <em>Summer Pockets</em> under the stairs of the stadium. A friend noticed that the CGs on my screen looked “bigger” than his. It turned out that 16:9 CGs don’t display fully on non-standard screens — you need to scroll to see everything. On the one hand, Key&rsquo;s game engine should probably be updated; on the other, I realized the advantage of 16:9. When I found that the iPhone SE still used a 16:9 screen, it instantly became my top choice.<br />
  Also, it uses an LCD screen — which I personally prefer for its longevity, eye-friendliness, and affordability. Of course, OLED and LCD each have their pros and cons.<br /></p>
<p><img src="ATRIMDM.JPG" alt="ATRI -My Dear Moments-"><br />
<br /></p>
<p>  This iPhone SE lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, it has speakers and a mic on the bottom, with the earpiece doubling as a second speaker — like the iPhone X. I had to buy a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter to use my ATH-CK350iS earphones. I mostly listen to classical music and care about audio quality. The ATH-CK350iS is entry-level but with 24-ohm impedance, it pairs well with this iPhone — though it can’t decode DSD.<br /></p>
<p><img src="HEADPHONE.JPG" alt="Headphone"><br />
<br /></p>
<p>  About the battery — small phone, small battery. Its capacity is around 2,000mAh. For my use (3–6 hours/day with 4G on), it’s just enough. I use it for calls, messaging, email, WeChat (mostly for health QR codes), and gaming. If I game more, I end the day with ~20%. If less, I have ~30% left. I usually sleep at 9 p.m., so this is fine for me.<br /></p>

<img src="BTR2.PNG" alt="BatteryUsage2"><br />
<img src="BTR3.PNG" alt="BatteryUsage3"><br />
<br /></p>
<p>  Compared to my high school days with the iPhone 6s (smaller battery), I played fewer games then — mostly <em>Arknights</em> and visual novels. I relied on email over WeChat and used 3G mode, which saved power. It barely made it to bedtime with 10% left, but I managed.<br />
  Now, with a larger battery, the SE lasts longer and is easier to manage. In short — whether this phone works for you depends entirely on your needs.<br /></p>
<p>  As for the camera: it only has one. Compared to pro cameras with larger CMOS sensors and interchangeable lenses, phone cameras are inherently limited. They rely heavily on computational photography — algorithms run by the CPU and GPU to compensate. Multi-lens phones narrow the gap a bit.<br />
  In this era, the SE’s single camera might seem outdated. But remember, it’s an SE — it’s powered by the A15 chip from the iPhone 13 series, one of the fastest around. That chip does improve photo quality a lot. But personally, I rarely use phones for serious photography — I have a Samsung WB35F for that. My phone camera is mostly for scanning codes and taking notes.<br />
  While the SE’s camera is second only to the iPhone 13 series, I still believe no amount of algorithmic enhancement can match true lens-captured images. That said, Apple’s camera tuning is among the most realistic — it aims to reproduce reality, not beautify.<br />
  I’m not a photography expert, so if you&rsquo;re interested in that, check out more specialized reviews.<br /></p>

<p>0x03: Feelings<br />
<br />
  I’ve used this phone for over a week now.<br />
  Before I bought it, my dad asked me: “Why would Apple release a phone that still uses a non-full screen, has only one camera, and looks the same as a five-year-old model — but with the fastest processor? Is it just nostalgia? Or targeting budget-conscious users?”<br />
  On reflection, I don’t think nostalgia or cost alone explain it. Budget-conscious buyers don’t necessarily buy budget phones — I’m an example. My parents spent nearly a month’s salary on this device. It’s expensive, yes, but if it lasts me 7–10 years, it’s worth it. Buying a cheap phone that dies in 3–4 years would be more wasteful in the long run.<br />
  The reason I chose this iPhone is the same reason Apple made it: the 16:9 screen, the eye-friendly LCD, the compact size that fits in one hand, and the excellent value. This phone feels tailor-made for me. Customers’ needs aren’t always aligned with trends. Even if full-screen displays and multiple cameras dominate, they mean nothing if the user doesn’t <em>need</em> them. Instead, Apple can use the saved cost to improve build quality and refine the OS — that’s what makes a product art.<br />
  That’s why the iPhone SE exists. That’s why I bought it. Why should I give up a phone that fits me perfectly, just to chase trends and buy features I don’t need? Like Mr. Jobs said:
“Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like… It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”<br /></p>
